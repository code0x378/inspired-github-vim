# Inspired GitHub Color Scheme for Vim

This is a very basic, incomplete vim color scheme inspired by other inspirables...  

* [InspiredGitHub.tmtheme](https://github.com/sethlopezme/InspiredGitHub.tmtheme)
* [vscode-theme-inspiredgithub](https://github.com/dareenzo/vscode-theme-inspiredgithub)

Airline users can try the [sol theme](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/wiki/Screenshots).  It's not perfect but close enough for now.
